**Project**
The objective of this project is to develop a simulation of a sales chat where the AI plays the role of a client and the user must make a sale as a means of practice sales skills. More specifically, it will simulate a situation where the user is offering financial services. This was chosen since we have a dataset of past calls in this situation.
The app will be a chat interface where the AI answers using a model fine-tuned in real sales conversations. Moreover, the app will also have a copilot, which gives recommendation to the seller of how to answer to technical questions by having access to a knowledge base of pdfs of finance documents using RAG.
